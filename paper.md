# Summary
To investigate the putative affect-reducing effect of the clinical method lateral eye movement (EMD) an experimental treatment was performed by means of @EMDA. Assuming that arousal reduction and mood elevation compared to other types of distractions are significant, an emotionally colored excitement was generated, followed by lateral eye movement and two variants of distraction. 
Results suggest an effect in arousal reduction compared to distraction in general and to a specific distraction condition in particular [@Schrausser:1994]. 
# Statement of need
The method of 'Eye Movement Desensitization' (EMD) was developed by Francine Shapiro in 1989 to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), see APAGD:2019. According to DSM [@APA:2013] PTSD is defined by (a) constant reliving of a traumatic experience, (b) avoidance of thoughts about that situation and (c) an associated increased level of arousal.
@Shapiro:1989 describes the process of treating PTSD with EMD as follows: At the beginning, the client should visualize the traumatic event as vividly and in as much detail as possible. Then the therapist moves his finger rhythmically from right to left at a distance of $d=30$ cm from the client's head and with a deflection of again $d=30$ cm, with a pendulum movement per second. During the imagining of the traumatic event, the patient generally follows the therapist's finger with his eyes until the imaginings become bearable. The length of such a set is given as $n=15$ to $n=25$ lateral eye movements. A stable effect was reported in a follow-up after three months.
As explaination how EMD works, @Shapiro:1989 refers to the fact that experiencing a traumatic event disturbs the balance between excitation and inhibition in the brain [@Pavlov:1929], lateral eye movements should be able to restore this balance. The advantage of the method is seen in the fact that the treatment with EMD is very short and the client is not exposed to intense fear for a long time [@Shapiro:1996].
 @Vaughan:1994 first examined the effect of EMD on the major symptom groups of PTSD and found that all three categories of PTSD (see above) as well as depression were significantly improved.
The aim of this study by means of @EMDA procedure was to induce an emotionally colored arousal, one of the three symptom groups of PTSD, and investigating whether lateral eye movements reduce this activation more than (a) fixing a stable target or (b) a different kind of distraction. Arousal was achieved by sbjects placed in a situation triggering evaluation-anxiety, as this was found significantly positively correlated with arousal levels [@Guerin:1983]. In order to rule out possible placebo effects, arousal was indirectly measured via short-term memory  [@Walker:1958; @Kesner:1973]. 
The method (EMD, EMDR, res.) received further confirmation, for example in @Shapiro:2002, @, @, or @.
# Treatment
A moving bar was rendered on a monitor make eye movements imperceptible to subjects \autoref{fig:treatment1} Additionally a tripod-mounted video camera was placed to the left of the subjects left to maintain an anxiety-provoking situation. The moving bar changed color from green to blue with a probability of $p=0.13$ per pass. Each blue bar was to be reported as 'blue'. One run from left to right and back lasted for $s=3$ seconds each of $t=60$ runs, resulting in a $m=3$ minute treatment duration.
In order to fix the central object, four rectangles were rendered on the screen \autoref{fig:treatment2}. These rectangles appeared either blue or green every $s=3$ seconds ($p=0.50%$). As soon as all four rectangles displayed the same color ($p=0.13$), subject again had to react ('blue' or 'green'). Duration of the procedure again was $m=3$ minutes. EMDA was implemented in QBasic for Microsoft DOS 6.0 to perform treatment procedures and timing. Further programs [@EMDapk] and @ were created for handheld Android operation systems  (versions 4.0 or higher), performing treatment part 1 described above, that is the moving bar in green color to induce the EMD, this with selectabe speed for use in the field.
